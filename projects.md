| :one: | Roadmap planner | <br /> Planning activities for the next week is an easy task, but when i got an exhausting (by work or sport) week, that I know that next one will be a high stress week, with meetings, presentations, high priority tasks, it become a difficult and time comsumming task. This app main goal is to unload some of this weight by automatically plan my next week according to some parameters ( weather : for outdoor activities, my receit list for the week, my shopping list, my daily sport activities, my rest time, my daily routine , etc ...) <br /><br /> | no repo available because of privacy |

| :two: | [Rush app](https://github.com/Draed/rush_app)| <br /> This application is used in my PDCA evolution process, which serve to improve, acknowledge or complete my skills, especially in the seconde part "Do". The first element of the lemming wheel is well know my most of people, as the "plan" or "project management and planification" part and is very documented. But after a good planning, doing the task and following it, is not so easy, lot of event can happen : lack of motivation, burnout, exhaustion, mental and physical fatigue, high stress, all of these factors can drastically decrease productivity. This app will help me to have healthy working session with : starting with concentration exercices before doing my tasks, planning my next pause (for drinking water, make some physical exercices, etc ...).  <br /><br /> | [@Draed/rush_app](https://github.com/Draed/rush_app) |
